# [BCC-Contributor](https://github.com/edwinsamodra/bcc-contributor)

## Brief Story
Someone just finished creating a website to document BCC contributors in 2022. Since the creator wanted new contributors to create PR for the first time, the author didn't write all the names of the contributors themselves. However, giving contributors the freedom to do it themselves.

## Demo
[https://bcc-contributor.netlify.app](https://bcc-contributor.netlify.app)

## Objectives

- Make a contribution to an open source project.
- Get more comfortable in using GitHub.

## Who is this for?

- This is for absolute beginners.
- It is for those with a little more experience but who want to make their first open source contribution.

## What am I going to contribute?

    <div class="card-header">
        <img src="YOUR_PICTURE_URL" />
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
        <span class="tag tag-teal">Your Departement</span>
        <h3>YOUR_NAME</h3>
        <p>
            YOUR_SHORT_DESCRIPTION
        </p>
        <div class="sosmed">
            <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME">
                <i class="bi-github" style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: black;"></i>
            </a>
            <a href="https://instagram.com/YOUR_USERNAME">
                <i class="bi-instagram" style="font-size: 1.8rem; color: black;"></i>
            </a>
        </div>

    }
    
    .tag-purple {
        background-color: #5e76bf;
    }

    .tag-pink {
        background-color: #cd5b9f;
    }
</style>
```
